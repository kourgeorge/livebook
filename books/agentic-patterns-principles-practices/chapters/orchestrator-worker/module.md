# Orchestrator-Worker (Coordinator) Pattern

## Motivation

A conductor coordinates an orchestra, assigning parts to different sections while maintaining the overall vision. A project manager breaks down a complex project, delegates specialized tasks to team members, and synthesizes their contributions into a cohesive result. The Orchestrator-Worker pattern mirrors this: a central coordinator breaks down complex goals, delegates to specialized workers, and integrates their outputs into a unified solution.

## Pattern Overview
**What it is:** A central agent, often called the Coordinator or Lead Agent, dynamically breaks down a complex goal into smaller subtasks, delegates them to specialized worker agents, and synthesizes the workers' outputs to produce the final result.

**When to use:** For complex tasks that cannot be handled by a single agent, especially when the required subtasks are unpredictable and dynamic, rather than fixed. It's the most common pattern for complex tasks.

**Why it matters:** It enables **specialization** (assigning tasks to dedicated agents with specific skills), **parallelization** (often running subtasks concurrently for speed), and **resilience** (isolating failures to individual agents).

The Orchestrator-Worker pattern, also known as the Coordinator pattern, represents one of the most fundamental and widely-used multi-agent architectures. Unlike rigid, predefined workflows, this pattern enables dynamic task decomposition where the orchestrator agent analyzes the high-level goal and determines the necessary subtasks at runtime. This flexibility makes it particularly powerful for handling complex, unpredictable tasks that require diverse expertise.

The pattern's strength lies in its ability to leverage specialization. Each worker agent can be optimized for a specific domain—research, writing, coding, analysis, or review—resulting in higher quality outputs than a single generalist agent could produce. The orchestrator acts as a strategic coordinator, managing the overall workflow, handling dependencies between subtasks, and synthesizing results into a coherent final output.

This pattern is especially valuable for long-horizon tasks where the orchestrator can maintain high-level context and goals while workers focus on specific execution details. The separation of concerns also enables better context management, as the orchestrator can isolate context for specific agents, preventing information overload and improving efficiency.

### Key Concepts
- **Orchestrator (Coordinator/Lead Agent):** The central agent that receives high-level goals, decomposes them into subtasks, delegates to workers, and synthesizes results.
- **Worker Agents:** Specialized agents that execute specific subtasks using domain expertise and specialized tools.
- **Dynamic Task Decomposition:** The orchestrator determines subtasks at runtime based on the input, rather than using fixed workflows.
- **Specialization:** Each worker agent focuses on a specific domain or capability, improving overall system effectiveness.
- **Parallelization:** Independent subtasks can be executed concurrently by different workers, reducing overall latency.
- **Hierarchical Organization:** Workers can themselves become orchestrators for sub-subtasks, creating nested multi-agent structures.
- **Context Isolation:** The orchestrator can manage and isolate context for specific agents, improving efficiency and preventing information overload.

### How It Works: Step-by-step Explanation

1. **Receive and Decompose:** The Orchestrator receives a high-level user request. It uses an AI model for reasoning to analyze and dynamically break the request into smaller, manageable pieces (subtasks).

2. **Delegate:** The Orchestrator dispatches each subtask to the most appropriate specialized worker agent. The Orchestrator must provide clear, non-overlapping objectives to the subagents to avoid duplication of work or gaps in coverage.

3. **Execute and Return:** Worker agents execute their specific task, often using specialized tools (e.g., querying a database or calling an API). They return their findings to the Orchestrator.

4. **Synthesize:** The Orchestrator integrates the outputs from all worker agents to compile and return the final, coherent response to the user.

## When to Use This Pattern

### ✅ Use when:
- **Complex, multifaceted tasks:** Tasks that require diverse expertise or multiple distinct capabilities that no single agent can handle effectively.
- **Dynamic task requirements:** When subtasks cannot be predetermined and must be determined at runtime based on the input.
- **Specialization needed:** Different aspects of the task require specialized knowledge or skills (e.g., research, writing, coding, review).
- **Parallel processing possible:** Multiple independent sub-tasks can be executed concurrently by different agents.
- **Long-horizon tasks:** Tasks that span many steps where maintaining high-level context is essential.
- **Context window limitations:** Tasks where the full context exceeds a single agent's context window capacity.
- **Resilience requirements:** When isolating failures to individual agents is important for system reliability.

### ❌ Avoid when:
- **Simple single-agent tasks:** Tasks that can be effectively handled by a single, well-configured agent.
- **Fixed workflows:** When tasks follow a rigid, predetermined sequence that doesn't benefit from dynamic decomposition.
- **Tight coupling required:** Tasks where sub-tasks are so tightly coupled that coordination overhead exceeds benefits.
- **Low-latency requirements:** When the overhead of multi-agent coordination and communication is prohibitive.
- **Resource constraints:** When computational or cost constraints (increased model calls) make multiple agents impractical.
- **Minimal complexity:** When the added complexity of multi-agent coordination doesn't provide sufficient benefit.

### Decision Guidelines
Use the Orchestrator-Worker pattern when the benefits of specialization, parallelization, and dynamic task decomposition outweigh the added complexity and coordination overhead. This pattern is ideal for complex tasks where subtasks are unpredictable and require diverse expertise. Consider: task complexity (complex = orchestrator-worker), specialization needs (diverse expertise = multiple workers), and dynamic requirements (unpredictable = dynamic decomposition). However, be aware of trade-offs: this pattern increases model calls, which raises latency, token throughput, and operational costs compared to a single-agent system. For simple or tightly-coupled tasks, a single agent or simpler workflow may be more efficient.

## Practical Applications & Use Cases

The Orchestrator-Worker pattern is the most common pattern for complex agentic tasks, enabling sophisticated systems that can handle multifaceted problems.

- **Anthropic's Research System:** The LeadResearcher agent (Orchestrator) analyzes a complex query, develops a strategy, and spawns multiple specialized Subagents (Workers) in parallel to investigate different aspects. The orchestrator saves its plan to memory before spawning subagents, enabling better context management.

- **Customer Service:** A coordinator agent analyzes a customer's request (e.g., order status, refund, technical support) and routes the task to the appropriate specialized agent (billing specialist, technical support agent, product information agent).

- **Code Generation:** Useful for products that involve complex changes across multiple files, where the Orchestrator determines which files need modification and delegates to specialized coding agents.

- **Research and Report Generation:** An orchestrator breaks down research into sub-topics, delegates to specialized researcher agents who work in parallel, then a writer agent synthesizes findings into a comprehensive report.

- **Content Creation Workflows:** A planner agent creates an outline, writer agents draft sections in parallel, and an editor agent reviews and refines the content for quality and consistency.

- **Scientific Research:** Multiple specialized agents collaborate on hypothesis generation, experimental design, data analysis, and paper writing, with an orchestrator coordinating the overall research process.

- **Multi-file Software Projects:** An orchestrator analyzes requirements, identifies affected files, and delegates changes to specialized agents (frontend, backend, database, testing).

```

**Explanation:**
This example demonstrates the core orchestrator-worker pattern: the orchestrator dynamically decomposes the goal into subtasks, delegates to specialized workers (research, writing), and synthesizes the results. The orchestrator maintains the plan and coordinates the workflow, while workers focus on their specialized domains.

### Advanced Example: Hierarchical Orchestrator with Context Management

# Orchestrator synthesizes
final_output = orchestrator.synthesize_results(
    decomposition["goal"],
    worker_results

```

**Explanation:**
This advanced example demonstrates hierarchical orchestrators with context management. The orchestrator saves its plan to external memory before spawning workers (enabling better context management), delegates with isolated context for each worker, and synthesizes results. Workers can themselves become orchestrators for complex subtasks, creating nested structures.

## Key Takeaways

- **Core Concept:** The Orchestrator-Worker pattern enables dynamic task decomposition where a central orchestrator breaks down goals into subtasks and delegates to specialized workers.

- **Key Benefits:** Specialization, parallelization, and resilience are the primary advantages, enabling complex tasks that exceed single-agent capabilities.

- **Dynamic Flexibility:** Unlike fixed workflows, the orchestrator determines subtasks at runtime, making it adaptable to unpredictable task requirements.

- **Context Management:** The orchestrator can save plans to memory before spawning workers, enabling better context isolation and management.

- **Trade-offs:** This pattern increases model calls, latency, token throughput, and operational costs compared to single-agent systems. Use when benefits outweigh costs.

- **Best Practice:** Provide clear, non-overlapping objectives to workers to avoid duplication and ensure complete coverage. Maintain the high-level goal throughout execution.

- **Common Pitfall:** Over-coordination can add unnecessary overhead. Ensure workers have clear roles and minimal coupling. Avoid using this pattern for simple tasks that a single agent can handle.

- **Hierarchical Potential:** Workers can themselves become orchestrators for complex subtasks, creating nested multi-agent structures for very complex problems.

## Related Patterns

This pattern works well with:
- **Planning:** Orchestrators create plans that guide task decomposition and worker coordination.

- **Persistent Task List (Recitation):** Orchestrators maintain and recite plans to keep high-level goals visible while workers execute subtasks.

- **Leverage External Memory:** Orchestrators save plans to external memory before spawning workers, and workers can store results externally.

- **Context Compression:** Orchestrators compress worker outputs, storing details externally and keeping summaries in context.

- **Routing:** Orchestrators use routing logic to delegate tasks to appropriate workers based on task type and worker capabilities.

- **Parallelization:** Independent subtasks can be executed concurrently by different workers, reducing overall latency.

This pattern is often combined with:
- **Multi-Agent Architectures:** This is the most common pattern within multi-agent systems.

- **Tool Use:** Each worker may have specialized tools for their domain (research tools, coding tools, writing tools).

- **Memory Management:** Shared state and context enable orchestrator-worker coordination.

- **Inter-Agent Communication:** Workers need mechanisms to communicate results back to the orchestrator.
